However, it is significantly challenging to assess their security for several reasons. Manual analysis is inevitable because of the obscurity and complexity of baseband firmware; however, such analysis requires repetitive efforts to cover diverse models or versions. Automating the analysis is also non-trivial because the firmware is significantly large and contains numerous functions associated with complex cellular protocols. Therefore, existing approaches on baseband analysis are limited to only a couple of models or versions within a single vendor. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named BaseSpec, which performs a comparative analysis of baseband software and cellular specifications. By leveraging the standardized message structures in the specification, BaseSpec inspects the message structures implemented in the baseband software systematically. It requires a manual yet one-time analysis effort to determine how the message structures are embedded in target firmware. Then, BaseSpec compares the extracted message structures with those in the specification syntactically and semantically, and finally, it reports mismatches. These mismatches indicate the developer mistakes, which break the compliance of the baseband with the specification, or they imply potential vulnerabilities. We evaluated BaseSpec with 18 baseband firmware images of 9 models from one of the top three vendors and found hundreds of mismatches. By analyzing these mismatches, we discovered 9 erroneous cases: 5 functional errors and 4 memory-related vulnerabilities. Notably, two of these are critical remote code execution 0-days. Moreover, we applied BaseSpec to 3 models from another vendor, and BaseSpec found multiple mismatches, two of which led us to discover a buffer overflow bug.\n","tags":[],"title":"BaseSpec: Comparative Analysis of Baseband Software and Cellular Specifications for L3 Protocols","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Insu Yun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625718438,"objectID":"ad7f331fb7c111d0d32fa109d7260bc3","permalink":"https://kaist-hacking.github.io/publication/yun-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-07-08T04:27:18.362735Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Concolic Execution Tailored for Hybrid Fuzzing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Insu Yun","Dhaval Kapil","Taesoo Kim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605927634,"objectID":"ea8cb68cf4bf59c0580bce923e050c53","permalink":"https://kaist-hacking.github.io/publication/yun-archeap/","publishdate":"2020-11-21T07:51:46.805847Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun-archeap/","section":"publication","summary":"Exploitation techniques to abuse metadata of heap allocators have been widely studied because of their generality (i.e., application independence) and powerfulness (i.e., bypassing modern mitigation). However, such techniques are commonly considered arts, and thus the ways to discover them remain ad-hoc, manual, and allocator-specific.\n\nIn this paper, we present an automatic tool, ArcHeap, to systematically discover the unexplored heap exploitation primitives, regardless of their underlying implementations. The key idea of ArcHeap is to let the computer autonomously explore the spaces, similar in concept to fuzzing, by specifying a set of common designs of modern heap allocators and root causes of vulnerabilities as models, and by providing heap operations and attack capabilities as actions. During the exploration, ArcHeap checks whether the combinations of these actions can be potentially used to construct exploitation primitives, such as arbitrary write or overlapped chunks. As a proof, ArcHeap generates working PoC that demonstrates the discovered exploitation technique.\n\nWe evaluated ArcHeap with ptmalloc2 and 10 other allocators, and discovered five previously unknown exploitation techniques in ptmalloc2 as well as several techniques against seven out of 10 allocators including the security-focused allocator, DieHarder. To show the effectiveness of ArcHeap's approach in other domains, we also studied how security features and exploit primitives evolve across different versions of ptmalloc2.\n","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Techniques to Systematically Discover New Heap Exploitation Primitives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yonghwi Jin","Jungwon Lim","Insu Yun","Taesoo Kim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605927634,"objectID":"5d5f2c21ae76a5e24b82451a8b3db3b5","permalink":"https://kaist-hacking.github.io/publication/jin-pwn-2-own-2020-safari/","publishdate":"2020-11-21T07:51:46.973052Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jin-pwn-2-own-2020-safari/","section":"publication","summary":"Compromising a kernel through a browser is the ultimate goal for offensive security researchers.

We observed, however, that existing fuzzing approaches, either generative or mutational, fall short in fully harvesting high-quality input corpora such as known proof of concept (PoC) exploits or unit tests. Existing fuzzers tend to destruct subtle semantics or conditions encoded in the input corpus in order to generate new test cases because this approach helps in discovering new code paths of the program. Nevertheless, for JavaScript-like complex programs, such a conventional design leads to test cases that tackle only shallow parts of the complex codebase and fails to reach deep bugs effectively due to the huge input space.\n\nIn this paper, we advocate a new technique, called an aspect-preserving mutation, that stochastically preserves the desirable properties, called aspects, that we prefer to be maintained across mutation. We demonstrate the aspect preservation with two mutation strategies, namely, structure and type preservation, in our fully-fledged JavaScript fuzzer, called DIE. Our evaluation shows that DIE's aspect-preserving mutation is more effective in discovering new bugs (5.7 x more unique crashes) and producing valid test cases (2.4 x fewer runtime errors) than the state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers. DIE newly discovered 48 high-impact bugs in ChakraCore, JavaScriptCore, and V8 (38 fixed with 12 CVEs assigned as of today).
